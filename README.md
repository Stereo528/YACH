# YACH (Yet Another Coordinate HUD)

Yet Another Coordinate HUD is a simple mod adding your XYZ coordinates displayed above your hotbar.

##  Additions
- Text above hotbar, wonder what it displays!
- Config for the very few options, mainly toggling it and enable/disable in spectator.
- It even has a keybind! All it does is toggle it though...
